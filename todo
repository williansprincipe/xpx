Important:
  Check area value;!!!!
  log - fit error!!!
Region.h:27
  bound check for XPSData::Sequences_row
meta:
  debug_msg_stack
  err_msg_stack
Parser:
  remove valtypeEnum
General:
-test plot only data and plot script + data
-correct cammel Fit -> fit  Shirley -> shirley ...
-transfer genDefaltPlot2D from Region to Plot2D as another constructor
change settings to convert strings to enum on reading and vice versa
on writing and so only use enum within the program.
encapsulate settings and all global stuff together with post in some control
class and make the objects robust so that they can compile and run without
this class

Check if is necessary separate dbg from post.
    But keep its declaration in post.h.

This is NOT good!
It's a waste of time
It's hard to maintain
Programmers should be able to understand the behavior from code and to write
small piece of code for debug IF NECESSARY.
+----
| - each class could have a static member function that return info about the it
|   for debug and development purposes.
| - each class could have a member function that writes to ostream& argument the
|   content of the object in a human readable form (a serialization). For debug
|   and development purposes.
+----

Fails worthing be noted must have a place holder (status) in the object or
  class at which the failing code register the description and a code. These
  information can be read (pull) by the caller afterwards.
Region:
  write setters and getters
