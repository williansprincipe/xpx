Bugs

1. When one fires testpost --helpx
   or             testpost --createlogfiles
   or             testpost --(option with vvMUSTNOTEXIST but gives an justaposed option)
                  there is the problem showed bellow.

2. Parse is crawded of error messages and debug messages.
3. dbg cant use msg, dbg or err for while.
